# React + Vite

Read through and implement the tutorial.

Preferably, develop in a local environment, then push to GitHub and submit the link. (See: the second "Note" in the tutorial.) If you have difficulty developing the tutorial in local, you can also fork in CodeSandbox and submit a link to your sandbox, but please try to do it in local first and message our Slack channel if you are unable to do it.

Bonus: Make an improvement. Either refactor some part of the code to increase readability/maintainability, or add a feature, or improve the styling / UI design. Tell us what you have improved in the comments, attach a screenshot if relevant.

Also, if needed, make a comment here with:
Anything that you haven't managed to get working. Include screenshots / error messages.
Any ideas or pieces of code that don't make sense to you in this tutorial.
Ideas or code elements that you'd like us to explain deeper in the upcoming sessions.
